{"body":"A devroom devoted to free/libre/open-source software developed for (and developed by) scientists, be it in academia or industry.\r\n\r\nWe aim at having a dozen or two short talks introducing projects, advertising brand new features of established tools, discussing issues relevant to development of software for scientific computing, and touching the interdependence of FLOSS and open science. We welcome contributions on topics such as number-crunching libraries, science-inclined compilers and parallelisation techniques, data analysis environments, scientific file formats, plotting/visualisation packages, licensing issues in science - anything that is relevant to development of FLOSS for scientists.\r\n\r\n* Conveners:\r\n  - Sylwester Arabas - University of Warsaw\r\n  - Juan Antonio Añel - University of Oxford, GNU Project\r\n  - Christos Siopis - Université Libre de Bruxelles\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
